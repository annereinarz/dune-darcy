# dune-darcy - README#

To install run:

dune-common-2.5.1/bin/dunecontrol --builddir=$PWD/build/release/ --opts=release.opts all

in the main Dune folder

Now you can go to build/release/dune-darcy/src to run

./dune-darcy

Initially this will give you a singular matrix as the local operator
is not being built yet.

Have a look at the file localoperator_darcy.hh and fill in the required
lines.

If you are having trouble the initial commit contains the solution.
